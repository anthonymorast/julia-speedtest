# Julia Speedtest

The Julia programming lagnauge often claims to be as fast as C/C++ (at least with mathematical algorithms) but as easy to write as Python. 
This, coupled with my interested in learning the language, has inspired me to implement a series of mathematical algorithms
in both langauges and compare their run times. 

The algorithms I'm implementing are from an old (free) book I stumbled upon, "C/C++ Mathematical Algorithms For Scientists and Engineers" by 
Namir C. Shammas. The book was published in 1995 so the algorithms may be out of date. For the most part, I will probably rip off the 
C/C++ algorithms from the book, including efficiencies if I can find them, and port them to Julia.
