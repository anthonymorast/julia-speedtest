# Julia Speedtest

The Julia programming lagnauge often claims to be as fast as C/C++ (at least with mathematical algorithms) but as easy to write as Python. 
This, coupled with my interested in learning the language, has inspired me to implement a series of mathematical algorithms
in both langauges and compare their run times.
